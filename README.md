# Usage of decorators in the project

Decorators helps in wrapping a function and change its
execution functionality without actually changing the
existing code







## Reduces code

- Usage of class decorators reduces the number of lines
  of code inside the class as it contains only the
  initialization function and the call function


## Reduces errors

- Usage of decorators reduces errors due to circular
  import, as it forces us to import the functions
  and classes whenever necessary

## Avoids confusions

- Usage of decorators allows us to call the function directly instead of calling the method via the class
  name, which avoids code confusions and improves 
  code readability

## Restrictions

 - Usage of decorators cannot be efficient all the time
   as some of the functions might needed to be maintained
   as private, so in that case we can't explicitly define
   the function


## Complexity

- Usage of decorators in a large scale might lead to development
  of complex code, so in that case it is better to keep the 
  code simple based on the concepts of OOP pillars
